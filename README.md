# Jokes

Jokes is a quick project to refresh myself on the Elixir Phoenix web framework.
The home page lets a user generate random horrible jokes for all to enjoy!

The main page shows a Live View Phoenix front end and `/jokes` is a route for a normal html page.

## Phoenix info

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
